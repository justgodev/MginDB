# Contributing to MginDB

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MginDB! This document outlines the process and guidelines for contributing to this project. Following these guidelines helps maintain a high standard for the codebase, ensures smooth collaboration, and clarifies the legal aspects of your contributions.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for your branch:
- `feature/add-new-feature`
- `bugfix/fix-issue-#123`
- `improvement/update-documentation`

### 3. Write Tests

Ensure your changes are covered by tests. We strive for high test coverage to maintain code quality.

- **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for individual functions or components.
- **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests to verify that different parts of the system work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Add end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and validate the entire workflow.

### 4. Follow Coding Standards

Maintain consistency with the project's coding style. This includes:
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Code Formatting**: Follow the project's code formatting guidelines (e.g., use of linters).
- **Comments and Documentation**: Add comments and documentation where necessary to explain the purpose and functionality of your code.

### 5. Commit Changes

Write clear and concise commit messages. Each commit should represent a single logical change.

- **Format**: Use the format `type(scope): description`.
- **Types**: Use `feat` for new features, `fix` for bug fixes, `docs` for documentation updates, `style` for code style changes, `refactor` for code refactoring, `test` for adding or updating tests, and `chore` for other changes.

Example:
```plaintext
feat(authentication): add OAuth2 support

fix(login): resolve issue with session persistence
